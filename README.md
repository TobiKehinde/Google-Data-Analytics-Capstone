# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

A case study of the Google Data Analytics capstone project.

## Project Overview

Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, offers a bike-share program that features a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while those who purchase annual memberships are member riders. Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.

The director of marketing is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program, which may include email, social media, and other channels. I have been assigned the task of how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Problem statement:

**Cyclistic annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. In order to design marketing strategies for converting casual riders into annual members, how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

## Technical skills I applied:

_Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Data Presentation_

Dashboard visualization and Presentation slides were used to effectively communicate the findings and key insights.
